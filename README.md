### Hi there 👋, my name is Dev Errors
#### I am a C++ and Java Developer
I'm a passionate mod developer with over 5 years of experience in Java. I've worked on various modding projects for popular games such as Minecraft, Terraria, and Stardew Valley, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle.

In addition to my Java expertise, I also have knowledge of C++ and have used it extensively for memory hacking. I enjoy exploring the technical aspects of games and finding ways to enhance the player experience through modding.

Skills: Java / Gradle / Maven / C++
